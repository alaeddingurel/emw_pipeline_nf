This repo is a pipeline that takes an HTML/JSON formatted news articles and do several NLP on the given file. 

later this file will cross by all the components of the pipeline. The output of each component will be written directly to file.
where the output of each component is as follows, 

* Document classifier -> 'doc_label'=0/1 
* Violent_classifer -> 'is_violent'=0/1
* Sentence_classifier will tokenize the sentences and get their labels for 4 different classifers-> 
    * 'sentences'=[]
    * 'sentence_labels'=[]
    * 'sentence_tokens'=[[]]
    * 'Trigger_Semantic_label'=[] 
    * 'participant_semantic'=[] 
    * 'organizer_semantic'=[] 

* Token_classifers -> 'token_labels'=[[]]

* report script (`bin/out_to_csv.py`) will create a detailed report on sentence base and merge coreferensed setnences using `[NS]` token.

An example output row can be found at the end of the page.

This Repo contains two branchs ,
# [all_components](https://github.com/emerging-welfare/emw_pipeline_nf/tree/all_components)

This brach will run the pipeline as it illustrated in the flowchart. Where no filtering will be applied.

|   0 | http://en.people.cn/90001/90778/90858/90863/6309613.html | The economic loss from the cyclone Sidr which hit the country's southern and southwestern coastal areas on Nov. 15 night, is estimated at 2.31 billion U.S. dollars, the Financial Express reported Monday. A preliminary estimate puts the total loss from the cyclone at 2.31 billion U.S. dollars, including rural infrastructure, schools, crops and livestock. Principal Staff Officer (PSO) at the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen Masud Uddin Chowdhury told reporters Sunday after a coordination meeting between the government and business community. The meeting urged all to operate relief activities in coordination with the local administration for proper distribution of relief materials. The cyclone Sidr, one of the fiercest cyclones that hit the country in the last 131 years, affected 30 out of the country's 64 districts, leaving at least 3,199 dead, more than 1,000 missing and some 34,500 injured. According to the report by the Food and Disaster Management Ministry, nearly 6.9 million people of 1.6 million families were affected, some 1.2 million houses and crops on land of some 1.79 acres (about 725,000 hectares) were damaged either completely or partially. Besides, about 350,000 trees of different species were uprooted by the storm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |           0 |                0 | 0                 | The economic loss from the cyclone Sidr which hit the country's southern and southwestern coastal areas on Nov. 15 night, is estimated at 2.31 billion U.S. dollars, the Financial Express reported Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                         | 0                | 15:29, November 26, 2007 | nan                         | nan           | on Nov. 15 night | nan                 | nan          | nan       | nan                 | ind_act              | profesyonel                  | Labor_Union                  |

| 200 | http://en.people.cn/90001/90776/90883/6382301.html       | The website " www.anti-CNN.com " reflects public condemnation of some Western media's "distorted" reports of the riots in Lhasa, capital of China's Tibet Autonomous Region, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said on Thursday. "It is purely spontaneous condemnation and criticism by the Chinese people toward some Western media's irresponsible reports which violated professional ethnics," Qin said at a regular press conference. Qin was responding to a question concerning "www.anti-CNN.com", which its creators say they launched to expose the Western media's biased coverage of unrest in Tibet. "What the Tibetan incident leaves us is a mirror which tells us the true colours of some in the international community," he said. It includes a photograph on the CNN news network website showing people running in front of a military truck. The original picture uploaded by Chinese Internet users, however, also shows rioters throwing stones at the truck. Tens of thousands of people from China and abroad have been angered by biased and dishonest reports about the riots in Tibet by some Western media, and answered calls to condemn Western media organizations for exaggerated and distorted reporting of the issue. The Information Office of China's State Council has arranged a three-day trip for an international delegation of 26 journalists from 19 media organizations from different countries and regions, such as The Associated Press from the United States, the Financial Times from Britain, the South China Morning Post from Hong Kong and Central News Agency from Taiwan. Lhasa is returning to normal after the March 14 unrest that was believed to be organized, premeditated and masterminded by the Dalai Lama group. The unrest, involving beating, smashing, ransacking and arson, led to the deaths of at least 18 civilians and one police officer. It also left 382 civilians and 241 police officers injured, businesses looted, and residences, shops and vehicles torched. |           1 |                0 | 0                 | The website " www.anti-CNN.com " reflects public condemnation of some Western media's "distorted" reports of the riots in Lhasa, capital of China's Tibet Autonomous Region, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said on Thursday.                                                                                                                                                          | 1                | 08:18, March 28, 2008    | riots                       | Lhasa & Tibet | nan              | nan                 | nan          | nan       | nan                 | ind_act              | profesyonel                  | Labor_Union                  |
